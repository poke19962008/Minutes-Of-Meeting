The first season follows the rescue of Mr. Lincoln Burrows , who is accused of murdering Terrence Steadman , the brother of Vice President Caroline Reynolds . Lincoln is sentenced to death and is incarcerated in Fox River State Penitentiary where he awaits his execution. Lincoln's brother, brilliant structural engineer Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), is convinced of Lincoln's innocence and formulates an escape plan. In order to gain access to Fox River, Michael commits an armed robbery which results in his being sentenced to Fox River. In prison, Michael befriends the prison doctor Sara Tancredi  when he pretends to suffer from Type 1 diabetes, in order to gain daily access to the prison's infirmary, when he receives his daily insulin shots. The brothers' fight to ward off the execution is aided by their lifelong friend Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney), who begins to investigate the conspiracy that put Lincoln in jail. However, they are hindered by covert agents, members of an organization known as The Company. The Company was responsible for framing Lincoln, and they did so because of Lincoln's father Aldo Burrows (Anthony Denison), and his former connections with the company. The brothers, along with six other inmates,Mr. Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell , Benjamin Miles "C-Note" Franklin , David "Tweener" Apolskis , John Abruzzi , and Charles "Haywire" Patoshik (Silas Weir Mitchell), who come to be known as the Fox River Eight, escape in the episode immediately prior to the season finale, after using their prison industry privileges to dig an escape tunnel underneath the prison.
